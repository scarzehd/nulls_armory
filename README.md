# Null's Armory
Null is approaching. Gear up while you still can. Soon, a new foe will be added to the game.

## Gear

Null's Armory adds weapons and armor from across the multiverse. The Orthos Prime, the Crucible, and the True Knife will all be paramount in your fight against Null. Additionally, three custom armor sets with a unique Shields mechanic will make you withstand even the toughest of blows.

### Orthos Prime
The Orthos Prime has a chance to afflict enemies with the Wither effect. Each stack of the Wither effect on enemies increases damage dealt.

### Crucible
While in the Nether, the Crucible grows from dangerous to deadly. Smite down hellish foes with ease.

### True Knife
Pain begets pain. The higher your Level, the higher the Violence.

### Shield Armors
The Trench Resonator for strength, the SC-Scout for agility, and the Starman for balance. The Void has given these armors the special ability to generate Shields to protect their wearer. Each armor set has different max shields, recharge time, recharge delay, and overflow. When your shields are broken, take cover and wait for your shields to replenish, as excess damage will increase the delay.

## The End is the Beginning
For now, Null's Armory is intended to be at the end of vanilla progression. Other adventure-style mods can be used to fill in the gaps.

Dig to the bottom of the world. Only at the bed on which this place is built does the Void leak in. Look for the Ore. Craft the Ingots.
