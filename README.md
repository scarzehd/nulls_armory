# Null's Armory
Null is approaching. Gear up while you still can. Soon, a new foe will be added to the game.

## Gear
Null's Armory adds weapons and armor from across the multiverse. They will all be paramount in your fight against Null. Additionally, three custom armor sets with a unique Shields mechanic will make you withstand even the toughest of blows.

### Orthos Prime
A masterpiece in craftsmanship, an ancient race designed the Orthos Prime to leave enemies bleeding from its attacks. It is particularly deadly against enemies weakened in this way.
### Crucible
Molded from the nightmares of demons, the Crucible grows from dangerous to deadly while in the Nether   . Smite down hellish foes with ease.

### True Knife
Pain begets pain. The higher your Level, the higher the Violence.

### Yoshimitsu's Banner
A banner specialized in stealing souls. Experience gained is multiplied and restores health.

### Hellkite Claws
Lifted from The Thousand Hands Guild, these claws boast an impressive attack speed and range. Weild one of these claws in each hand to engage in Dragon Fangs, a stance which sacrifices health for further lethality.

### Shield Armors
The Trench Resonator for strength, the SC-Scout for agility, and the Starman for balance. The Void has given these armors the special ability to generate Shields to protect their wearer. Each armor set has different max shields, recharge time, recharge delay, and overflow. When your shields are broken, take cover and wait for your shields to replenish, as excess damage will increase the delay.

## The End is the Beginning
For now, Null's Armory is intended to be at the end of vanilla progression. Other adventure-style mods can be used to fill in the gaps.

Dig to the bottom of the world. Only at the bed on which this place rests does the Void leak in. Find the Ore. Craft the Ingots. The Void Compass will help you.
